                            TrackMyRupee started with a simple idea: understanding your finances shouldn't be complicated. We realized that many people struggle to keep track of their daily expenses, subscriptions, and budgets because existing tools were either too complex or too manual.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-muted">
                            We built TrackMyRupee to be the intuitive, powerful, and privacy-focused solution we always wanted for ourselves. Today, we help thousands of users track their spending, spot trends, and make smarter financial decisions.
